# UE5 Development Guide

## Install for Linux
We want Unreal 5.3, go to here https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux and find the 20GB, ```Linux_Unreal_Engine_5.3.zip```

## Critical Warning

**Always close Unreal Engine before running the live testing script.** Running the script while UE is open will crash the editor and may result in lost progress.

## Documentation
**Run UE Version 5.3.2 specifically**

Comprehensive documentation is available at:
https://byu-holoocean.github.io/holoocean-docs/v2.0.1/develop/env.html

## Known Issues

**Packaging**: The packaging process does not create a `content.json` file, though the documentation indicates this file should be generated. It is unclear whether this is a bug or documentation issue.
