# UE5 Development Guide

## Critical Warning

**Always close Unreal Engine before running the live testing script.** Running the script while UE is open will crash the editor and may result in lost progress.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available at:
https://byu-holoocean.github.io/holoocean-docs/v2.0.1/develop/env.html

## Known Issues

**Packaging**: The packaging process does not create a `content.json` file, though the documentation indicates this file should be generated. It is unclear whether this is a bug or documentation issue.
