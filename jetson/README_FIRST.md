# Intro to Jetson Orin Nano

## Why use it?
The Orin enables us to run ROS2 on a small, low power device. (See why ROS for why). Additioally having essentially a desktop computer allows us to be much more flexible with what code can run. As opposed to an Arduino, we can run a combination of python, C++, or whatever else we might need, along with having all the libraries. 

## Inital Setup
See [Jetson Setup](jetson_setup.md) for inital setup instructions.
