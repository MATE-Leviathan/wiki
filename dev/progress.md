## **Current Progress Towards ROS2**

## Development Enviorment
- Currently pretty well set up for local development
- Docker container + setup for ROS2
- Able to build code within container
- Waiting on Jetson Orin Nano DevKit for hardware testing and install


## Camera integration
- Done, node reads camera and publishes images
- Inital benchmarks show about 15fps, could be fast enough but might not be

## Sonar integration
- Done `ping2_sonar`

## Motor Control
- Still work in progress, need hardware and Arduino MEGA to start wiring and playing with it
